# Seeded account credentials

# Known accounts created by DatabaseSeeder.php:
admin@example.com,password,role=admin
owner@example.com,password,role=salon_owner
client@example.com,password,role=client

# Note: When you run the seeder (`php artisan db:seed`) the script generates many extra
# owner and client accounts and writes a larger list to `storage/app/logins.txt`.
# Use those credentials (email/password) to sign in. All generated accounts use the
# password: `password` unless you change the seeder.
